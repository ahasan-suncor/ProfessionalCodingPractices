    <dl>
      <dt>Abstraction</dt>
      <dd>Used to manage complexity in code by hiding implementation details and exposing only relevant information. For
        example, hiding complex details of a function so that other developers can use it without worrying about the
        details.</dd>
      <dt>Bug</dt>
      <dd>A mistake in a program that causes it to not work like it's supposed to.</dd>
      <dt>Codebase</dt>
      <dd>All the code that makes up a project in a repository. It includes all the files needed to run the program.
      </dd>
      <dt>Commenting</dt>
      <dd>Adding notes or descriptions to the code to help other developers understand what the code does. It is
        intended for developers working directly with the code to help them understand it. Block comments are usually
        used for documenting entire functions or sections of code, while inline comments can be used to explain specific
        lines of code.</dd>
      <dt>Dead Code</dt>
      <dd>Code that is no longer used or needed in the program, but still exists in the file.</dd>
      <dt>Documentation</dt>
      <dd>A high-level overview of the code that explains the purpose of the code, how it works, usage, edge cases, etc.
        This is often written as a docstring. They are intended to provide information to other users of the code, such
        as other developers who use the code or other people who want to understand how to use it.</dd>
      <dt>Function</dt>
      <dd>A block of code that performs a specific task.</dd>
      <dt>Method</dt>
      <dd>A function that is associated with an object or a class.</dd>
      <dt>Modular Code</dt>
      <dd>Code that is organized into smaller, reusable modules that can be easily combined to create more complex
        programs.</dd>
      <dt>Module</dt>
      <dd>A self-contained unit of code that typically includes multiple functions and can be used by other parts of a
        program. Often used to organize related functions and data together, so that they can be reused in other parts
        of the program without having to rewrite the same code.</dd>
      <dt>Readable Code</dt>
      <dd>Code that is easy to understand for other developers. It's written in a way that makes it clear what the code
        does, and how it does it.</dd>
      <dt>Refactoring</dt>
      <dd>Improving the design and structure of existing code without changing its functionality.</dd>
      <dt>Repository</dt>
      <dd>A place that holds all the files and code for a project.</dd>
      <dt>Sustainable Code</dt>
      <dd>Any other developer can maintain the code without the original author.</dd>
      <dt>Understandable Code</dt>
      <dd>Code that is not confusing or ambiguous, and other developers know what the code is doing and as a result can
        modify it, or spot bugs, refactor, etc.</dd>
      <dt>Uniform Code</dt>
      <dd>Follows consistent formatting and style conventions throughout a project such as using the same naming
        conventions for variables or following a specific indentation style.</dd>
